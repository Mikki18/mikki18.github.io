            <dd>
                The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is held in high regard by the development team, 
                and is cited as one of the main inspirations for Genshin Impact. 
                Development was aimed at making the game different and fun in terms of its quest and 
                combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration.
